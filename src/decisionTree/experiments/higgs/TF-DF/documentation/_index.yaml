        <p>
        <b>TensorFlow Decision Forests</b> (<b>TF-DF</b>) is a collection of state-of-the-art
        algorithms for the training, serving and interpretation of <b>Decision Forest</b>
        models. The library is a collection of <a href="https://keras.io/">Keras</a> models and
        supports classification, regression and ranking.
        <p>
        <p>
        TF-DF is a wrapper around the <a
        href="https://github.com/google/yggdrasil-decision-forests">Yggdrasil Decision Forest</a>
        C++ libraries. Models trained with TF-DF are <a href="https://github.com/google/yggdrasil-decision-forests/blob/main/documentation/user_manual.md#serving-tensorflow-decision-forests-model">compatible</a> with Yggdrasil Decision
        Forests' models, and vice versa.
        </p>
        <p>
        Unfortunately TF-DF is not yet available for
        <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/decision-forests/issues/16">Mac (#16)</a> or
        <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/decision-forests/issues/3">Windows (#3)</a>,
        we are working on it.
