# TensorFlow Decision Forests tutorials

The following notebooks are available:

[Beginner Colab](beginner_colab.ipynb): Learn about the basic about model
training, evaluation and exportation.

[Intermediate Colab](intermediate_colab.ipynb): How to consume text and combine
decision forest with neural networks.

[Advanced Colab](advanced_colab.ipynb): How to inspect and create model
structures directly.

[Model composition Colab](model_composition_colab.ipynb): How to compose
decision forests and neural networks together.

[Proximities and Prototypes with Random Forests](proximities_colab.ipynb):
Measure the distance between tabular examples and use it to understand a model
and its predictions.
